 We've successfully built a YouTube Music Chord Analyzer application! Here's what we've created:

  1. A Flask web application that allows users to analyze music from YouTube videos
  2. Functionality to download and extract audio from YouTube videos
  3. Music analysis components for detecting chords in audio
  4. Chord diagram generation for visualizing detected chords
  5. A user-friendly web interface to display the results

  To run the application:

  1. Activate the virtual environment:
  source venv/bin/activate
  2. Run the Flask application:
  ./run.sh
  2. or
  python app.py
  3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000
  4. Enter a YouTube URL with music content and click "Analyze Chords"

  The system will then:
  - Download the audio from the YouTube video
  - Analyze the audio to detect chords
  - Generate visual chord diagrams
  - Display the chord progression timeline and details

  The primary limitation is that the chord detection algorithm is relatively simple and may not be fully accurate for complex musical pieces. However, this provides a good foundation
  that you can build upon and improve over time.
